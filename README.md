simon says game
The Simon Game is a memory-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players follow an increasing sequence of flashing colors and sounds. JavaScript handles game logic, random sequence generation, event listeners, and animations, while CSS styles the interface. Each correct input advances the level; a mistake resets the game.
